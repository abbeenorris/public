                <p>This website has been created by George Allard, Abbie Norris and Ged Griska who are all Digital Media Design students. We've been given a brief of creating a social web based application that addresses a specific "problem" of a target audience of our choice. Through group meetings we have created a database which holds information for the website, and we have also identified a sector of society which we wish to target. This collaborative project will work alongside our own personal blogs to explain steps taken in this project (links below). </p>
